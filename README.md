| 1    | Social Media Screening and Procedural Justice: Towards Fairer Use of Social Media in Selection | 1. despite all benefits, social media screening in itself cannot be considered a procedurally just assessment tool.<br/>2. the potential benefits should not be neglected. The discussion has shown social media screening to have the potential of being a helpful contemporary tool in identifying the right job candidate and avoiding irresponsible behaviour and negligent hiring, as long as it is applied with care. | it is possible to enhance the fairness of this practice by establishing clear policies and procedures to standardize the process. It is therefore essential to follow some basic guidelines to address the aforementioned issues and to enhance procedural justice. | 1.benefits: low-cost source of information applicants 2.talk about ethical issues, ethnic values 3.provide an assessment of the procedural justice of social media screening and to articulate recommendations for a fairer use of social media in the selection process<br/>//have doubt |
| 2    | Job seekers' attitudes toward cybervetting: Scale development, validation, and platform comparison | 1. Participants with higher Facebook addiction reported slightly higher perceived justice perceptions. However, Facebook addiction was unrelated to privacy invasiveness or face validity.<br/>2. Unexpectedly, internet privacy concerns were significantly negatively correlated to both the face validity and perceived justice factors<br/>3. Instagram may have slightly less favorable perceptions than Facebook on some factors, possibly because it is more centered around images as opposed to text, and thus seen as less rel- evant for cybervetting.<br/>4. ATC scale is a reliable and valid indicator of three core elements of applicants' ATC across four of the most popular social media platforms. | Comparing applicants' attitudes across platforms showed significantly more favorable perceptions toward LinkedIn-based cybervetting than for the other three platforms. | talk about 3 different studies ATC applicants' attitudes towards cybervetting |
| 3    | Agree to disagree: Examining the psychometrics of cybervetting | 1. trait attributions may occur based on behavioral cues that are not valid indicators of underlying attributes<br/>2. there were some instances in which cross-method agreement was positively related to rater familiarity with Facebook and rater neuroticism and inversely associated rater extraversion and rater cognitive ability<br/>3. exploratory analyses revealed that rater assessments of professionalism, cognitive ability, openness to experience, and written communication carried the most weight in influencing perceptions of applicant suitability, This is particularly noteworthy, as these findings suggest that cybervetting may not be an appropriate substitute for more traditional selection assessments. | 1.cybervetting-based ratings generally differed from applicant test scores and self-assessment ratings, employers should use caution when utilizing this pre-employment screening technique | method: supervisors conducted cybervetting evaluations of applicant personality, cognitive ability, written communication skills, professionalism, and overall suitability psychometric: psychology metreics facebook profile only |
| 4    | Social Media for Selection? Validity and Adverse Impact Potential of a Facebook-Based Assessment | 1. Recruiter ratings generally are unrelated to graduates’ subsequent job performance, turnover intentions, and turnover.<br/>2. Facebook ratings do not provide incremental prediction of these criteria beyond more established predictors, including cognitive ability, personality, self-efficacy, CSE, and GPA.<br/>3. Facebook ratings tend to be higher for females than for males, and, in several instances, higher for White individuals than for Black and Hispanic individuals<br/>4. Our results also suggest there may be subgroup differences in such assessments that could lead to ethnicity-based adverse impact<br/>5. There are potential issues related to the availability of job-irrelevant information on SM and the lack of consistent information across applicants | 1.Recruiter ratings of applicants’ Facebook information were unrelated to supervisor ratings of job performance 2.Facebook ratings did not contribute to the prediction of these criteria beyond more traditional predictors | method: examing only based on facebook should be very cautious to use SM |
| 6    | Cybervetting job applicants on social media: the new normal? | 1. There is a relationship between comfort and one of the privacy concerns (COL) and having a previous negative experience, but many of the other factors previously identified in the privacy research were not applicable—including gender, job seeking status, social media use, and knowledge of privacy setting.<br/>2. About half of the participants were not comfortable with their publicly available social media data being used for social media screening<br/>3. organizations cannot assume that people are comfortable with cybervetting—even if they are on the job market<br/>4. organizations engaging in social media screening may open themselves up to claims of discriminatory hiringyoung people are generally not comfortable with social media screening | 1. young people are generally not comfortable with social media screening 2.public information on SM cannot be fully explained by some 'traditional' variables in privacy research | talk about privacy method: online survey                     |
| 7    | Is cybervetting valuable?                                    | //TODO review?                                               | it is the responsibility of the organizations engaged in cybervetting to identify specific goals, develop formal policies and practices, and continuously evaluate outcomes so that negative societal consequences are minimized | 1.initiate a discussion about the negative consequences of online screening and how they can be overcome 2. stakeholders can take to manage and ameliorate harmful outcomes of cybervetting 3. can improve the quality of individual hires. But this is untested 4. potential to substantially undermine equal opportunity in hiring 5. promotes privacy invasion |
| 13   | Examining the criterion-related validity evidence of LinkedIn profile elements in an applied sample | 1. LinkedIn profile elements are not strongly related to objective job performance<br/>2. It appears that having a summary section, listing one's employer in your interests, and having the company's logo as the background image significantly correlated with objective performance metrics. | 1.LinkedIn profile are not strongly correlated with organizational metrics. <br/>2.LinkedIn data may be more appropriate for providing information related to performance of current employees rather than prospective employees, potentially as an indicator of organizational commitment. | LinkedIn profile method: financial services professional,  objective sales performance metrics. Caution: using this information as hiring process |
| 16   | Cybervetting and the Public Life of Social Media Data        | 1.The model shows that the country and privacy concerns factors are the strongest predictors of comfort level. In particular, the comfort score was higher for respondents from India, supporting that one's culture plays a role in the social media screening context (RQ1)<br/>2. The result shows that the likelihood of being on the job market is not associated with people’s attitude toward social media screening; in other words, being a job seeker does not necessarily make one more or less comfortable with the practice<br/>3. Our research evidences no significant relationship between one's gender and the comfort level with social media screening.<br/>4. This finding suggests that higher concerns with social media sites collecting personal information and possibly using/sharing such information without users' consent are both associated with a lower comfort level with organizations using social media data to screen job applicants—even if the social media data are publicly available.<br/>5. Digital resignation refers to the situation where people are generally concerned about privacy, but they also reluctantly recognize that companies would still engage in this practice regardless of their concerns—especially when it comes to using publicly available social media data. | 1.cybervetting <=> undermine people's trust 2.privacy boundaries are not only important when it comes to private information, but also with information that is publicly available on social media 3.SM data public => no context-specific & data-specific expectation of privacy | about privacy method: survey<br/>culture                     |

| 18   | 'It is an attitude': the normalisation of social screening via profile checking on social media | 1. Overall, participants' accounts of profile checking and what they described as background information in the context of flat-sharing and study were deeply embedded in and rationalised using neoliberal narratives putting a strong emphasis on one's responsibility to proactively anticipate and manage one's safety and perceived social risks. <br/>2. In that respect, participants reported checking people's social media profiles in the context of prospective friendships in a way not dissimilar to digital dating. | 1.young people’s understandings and deployment of social media profile checking 2.encouraging surveillance practices as part of social media interactivity 3.producing specific understandings of social screening. | focus on young people method: interview focus on understand of SM profile checking<br/>//have some problem here |

| 26   | Social Media as Input for Recruiment: Does Women's Relationship History Affect Candidate Evaluations? | 1. a female candidate with a history of having multiple partners is overall evaluated less positively and is less likely to be hired than a candidate with only one partner<br/>2. Even though we did not explicitly refer to sexual partners but to 'relationships', participants interpret this information as being reflective of sexual activity, and judged the candidates accordingly<br/>3. simply providing information about the cause of commonly held stereotypes, including those about women's sexuality, might not be the best approach to combat biased person impressions and hiring decisions |                                                              | 1. female, gender<br/>2. social media information can influence hiring decisions, and that merely providing information about the origins of some of our prejudices is not sufficient to mitigate this influence |
| 30   | A digital job application reference: how do social media posts affect the recruitment process? | 1. The findings and results are revealed according to the SJT. In the recruitment process, the existing judgments with a candidate's posts on SMA influence decision-makers more than the logic or solidity of an idea itself<br/>2. The references specified by the candidate in the job application form do not always act objectively and may present the candidate over-favorably to help them get the job.<br/>3. HR managers in tourism businesses generally prefer to examine candidates' SMAs rather than traditional references because they can quickly and cheaply screen many applicants |                                                              | HR managers in the tourism industry generally prefer to examine candidates' SMAs rather than traditional references because they can quickly and cheaply screen many applicants. In addition, negative content posts of individuals on SM negatively affect recruiters' decisions. |
| 36   | Personality Disclosure on Social Network Sites: An Empirical Examination of Differences in Facebook Usage Behavior, Profile Contents and Privacy Settings |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |
| 39   | Social media snooping on job applicants The effects of unprofessional social media information on recruiter perceptions | 1. when HR professionals encounter a job applicant's unprofessional SNW content, they subsequently evaluate that job applicant more negatively, As a result, they are less likely to recommend the applicant be hired.<br/>2. We found that whether inferences about the person were accurate or not, experienced employers believe the information to be diagnostic<br/>3.  Despite some evidence from sociology and psychology research that supports the conclusion that females tend to be judged more harshly than males for similar behavior related to sex and drinking, our results indicate that men were evaluated more harshly than women.<br/>4. raters could have judged male applicants more harshly in comparison with female applicants because such stereotypes for college-aged females do not tend to be proliferated, resulting in more leniency |                                                              | related to bias on sex<br/>Unprofessional SNW information negatively affected ratings of applicants regardless of applicants' qualifications, while professional SNW profile information failed to improve evaluations regardless of qualifications |
| 40   | The Usage of Social Media Networks as a Tool by Employers to Screen Job Candidates | 1. suggest that employers in Malaysia are screening candidates' English language proficiency as an important criterion for job selection.<br/>2. This indicates that the usage of SNS as a tool by employers to screen job candidates is on the rise, and despite concerns about its legality, it needs to be taken seriously by prospective candidates. |                                                              | Prospective employees need to be aware that their behavior is being monitored through their SNS profiles and the information extracted has a great influence on their job prospects. |
