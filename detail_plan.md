## sections

### 1. bias in gender

| structure | evidence                                                     | sources |
| :-------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| CA        | a female candidate with a history of having multiple partners is overall evaluated less positively and is less likely to be hired than a candidate with only one partner<br/>simply providing information about the cause of commonly held stereotypes, including those about women's sexuality, might not be the best approach to combat biased person impressions and hiring decisions | 4       |
| A         | Facebook ratings tend to be higher for females than for males, and, in several instances, higher for White individuals than for Black and Hispanic individuals | 26      |
| A         | raters could have judged male applicants more harshly in comparison with female applicants because such stereotypes for college-aged females do not tend to be proliferated, resulting in more leniency | 39      |



### 2. privacy

| structure | evidence                                                     | sources |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| A         | young people are generally not comfortable with social media screening | 6       |
| A         | This finding suggests that higher concerns with social media sites collecting personal information and possibly using/sharing such information without users' consent are both associated with a lower comfort level with organizations using social media data to screen job applicants—even if the social media data are publicly available | 16      |
|           |                                                              |         |



### 3. work performance

| structure | evidence                                                     | sources |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| CA & A    | It appears that having a summary section, listing one's employer in your interests, and having the company's logo as the background image significantly correlated with objective performance metrics. <br/>BUT LinkedIn data may be more appropriate for providing information related to performance of current employees rather than prospective employees, potentially as an indicator of organizational commitment. | 13      |
| A         | Recruiter ratings generally are unrelated to graduates’ subsequent job performance, turnover intentions, and turnover. | 4       |
| A         | LinkedIn profile are not strongly correlated with organizational metrics. | 13      |
